# ROS-portfolio GROUP 7

Welcome to our learning portfolio, where we demonstrate our initial competencies in ROS (Robot Operating System). This project is part of our journey to understand robotic systems through hands-on tutorials and beginner simulations.



## For Non-Technical Audience

We are a group of students learning how to control robots using software. We used a simulated turtle robot to explore how robots move and respond to commands.


## ⚙️ For Technical Audience

This portfolio showcases our beginner-level ROS skills, including:

1. Building a ROS package [Building a ROS package](https://github.com/pokohroh/ros-portfolio/blob/b1d926216752347057fd42c3a662f23ac102c37e/Tutorials%20Completed/1%20Building%20a%20ROS%20package.md)
