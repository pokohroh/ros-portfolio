# ROS-portfolio GROUP 7

Welcome to our learning portfolio, where we demonstrate our initial competencies in ROS (Robot Operating System). This project is part of our journey to understand robotic systems through tutorials and beginner simulations.



## For Non-Technical Audience

We are a group of students learning how to control robots by giving them instructions through software. In this case, we used a simulated turtle robot to explore how robots move and respond to commands.


## For Technical Audience

This portfolio showcases our ROS competency learnt through tutorials, including:
