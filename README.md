# ROS-portfolio GROUP 7
* CURRENTLY STILL IN PROGRESS *

Welcome to our learning portfolio, where we demonstrate our initial competencies in ROS (Robot Operating System). This project is part of our journey to understand robotic systems through hands-on tutorials and beginner simulations.



## For General Audience

We are a group of students learning how to control robots using software. We used a simulated turtle robot to explore how robots move and respond to commands. Think of it like learning how to talk to a robot and make it do simple things like move forward, turn, or draw shapes, all using code!

## ⚙️ For Technical Audience

This portfolio showcases our beginner-level ROS skills, including:

- Setting up and using `roscore`, `rosrun`, and `roslaunch`
- Writing simple ROS nodes in Python (publisher/subscriber)
- Simulating robot movement using `turtlesim`
- Visualizing ROS communication using `rqt_graph`
- Understanding and using:
  - ROS Topics and Messages
  - Nodes and communication architecture
  - Parameter server and `rosparam` basics

Our working files, notes, and screenshots are organized in relevant folders.
